        "The French only need a valid passport to enter the kingdom. However, this stay cannot exceed 90 days \nTo move to Morocco, there are two types of residence permits depending on the duration of your expatriation:\n- The registration card: this is valid for one to ten years as long as you do not leave the territory for more than six months during this period. Once the validity period expires, you must have a residence card or a renewal to stay in the country.\n- The residence card: to obtain this residence permit, it is essential to justify a four-year and uninterrupted residence in Morocco. The card is issued for ten years and can be renewed. This option is therefore aimed at people who wish to settle in Morocco permanently.\nNote that it is mandatory to have a valid residence permit to carry out certain administrative procedures (opening a bank account, consular card, etc.).\nGood to know: children under 16 are not affected by registration."

        "The Official currency of Morocco is the Moroccan Dirham (MAD). The Dirham is divided into 100 centimes. The Dirham is available in denominations of 10, 20, 50, 100 and 200 Dirhams. Coins are available in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20 and 50 centimes, as well as 1, 2, 5 and 10 Dirhams. The Dirham is a closed currency, which means it can only be traded within Morocco. It is recommended to exchange currency at a bank or official exchange office. It is also recommended to keep receipts when exchanging currency, as they may be required when exchanging back to your home currency. It is also recommended to keep small bills on hand, as it is common for vendors to not have change for larger bills. Additionally, it is important to keep in mind that many vendors do not accept credit cards, so it is best to have cash on hand. "
